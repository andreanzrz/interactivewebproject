		Latin pop music is like pop music anywhere, heavily produced and usually marketed towards
		the masses. According to <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/latinmusicusa/music/latin-pop/" target="_blank">PBS</a>,
		pop music holds some of its largest audiences in Latin America. This means that it shouldn't be surprising
		that I had to include this genre in my list. Because of how many pop artists there are, the list had to be 
		cut down extremely short. Don't worry, my list comes with many artists that I'm sure will satsify the pop 
		craving we all get every once in a while.&#9786;

		<h3><span class="purple">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></h3>

		To start off the list, let me introduce Sebastián Yatra.
		Yatra gained recognition in September of 2013 with his hit single "El Psicólogo", which charted all over Latin America,
		but most notably in his home country of Columbia, as well as Venezuela, Ecuador, and the U.S., as stated by 
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebasti%C3%A1n_Yatra" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>. Yatra then released a few more
		songs throughout the next 2 years, but it wasn't until 2016 that his song "Tracionera" charted and solidified his success.
		Yatra himself recommends anyone who is looking to get into his music to start off with "Traicionera"; I would also recommend
		listening to "Suena El Dembow", which has come out recently and is performed along with Joey Montana.

		<img src="haash.PNG" alt="haash"/><br>
		The next person on the list is Ha*Ash, which is a combination of their names, Hanna and Ashley. They are actually both sisters
		and they were both born in Lake Charles, Los Angeles. The website 
		<a href="https://www.allmusic.com/artist/haash-mn0000407099/biography" target="_blank">allmusic.com</a> states that the sisters 
		began singing in their home church at the ages of five and six. Ha*Ash are known to mix rock, pop, and country together in their
		songs. I recommend listening to their newest song "100 Años", which they perform along with Prince Royce
		(who I mention <a href="bachata.html">here</a>).
		<br>
		</p>
		<h3><span class="purple">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></h3>
		<p>
		<img src="reik.png" alt="reik"/><br>
		Reik is a special addition to the list, considering that they're a band. Reik was formed in Mexicali, Baja California in 2003. They 
		were later signed in 2004 and wrote their first self-titled album with hits like "Que Vida La Mia" and "Noviembre Sin Ti" in 2005.
		According to <a href="https://www.allmusic.com/artist/reik-mn0000628571/biography" target="_blank">allmusic.com</a>, Reik took a five
		year break shortly after the release of their 2011 album "Peligro", and later came back in 2016 with their newest album called "Des/Amor"
		which changed their sound. They wrote songs like "Voy a Olvidarte","Qué Gano Olvidándote", and "Ya Me Enteré" 
	    (which features Nicky Jam, who I talk about <a href="reggaeton.html">here</a>) that were great hits and did well on the charts.
