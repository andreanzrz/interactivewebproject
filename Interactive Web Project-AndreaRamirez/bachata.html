	Bachata is known for its specific guitar sound that comes from the Dominican
	Republic. According to <a href="http://www.iasorecords.com/music/what-is-bachata" target="_blank">iasorecords.com</a>,
	Bachata was first associated with poverty, prostitution, and poverty. This association was taken so 
	seriously that only one national radio would play it. Later on, these associations would transform
	the Bachata music style to a romantic style. As Bachata is today, it is at it's peak of popularity. 
	It's listened throughout Latin America and iasorecords claims it to be the most popular Latin genre in 
	New York City.

	Now onto artists that I think would be great introductions to Bachata that I would highly recommend!
	I think the easiest transition to Bachata would be to start off with Prince Royce, whose real name is
	Geoffrey Royce Rojas, and was born in The Bronx, New York. Prince Royce made his debut album in 2010. The
	website <a href="https://www.allmusic.com/artist/prince-royce-mn0002385531/biography" target="_blank">allmusic.com</a>
	states that Prince Royce's debut album was well received by Bachata fans and that the twenty-year old 
	was favorably compared to Aventura and other urban-oriented artists from New York. Prince Royce later 
	released his next album in 2012 called "Phase II", which reached platinum status and peaked at number
	16 on the Billboard 200. He continued to release albums in 2013 and 2014, called "Soy el Mismo" and 
	"Double Vision", respectively. The album "Double Vision" was sung primarily in English, a first for 
	Prince Royce. He also later released his newest album "Five" in 2017.

	The next artist that I will talk about is Romeo Santos. His full name is Anthony 'Romeo' Santos, and 
	he was also born in The Bronx, New York. When Romeo Santos was just thirteen, he formed the group called
	Los Teenagers, which was very popular in the New York City area. In 1999, Romeo Santos signed a record deal with the label 
	Premium Latin, and <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/romeo-santos-biography-and-artist-profile-2141886" target="_blank">thoughtco.com</a> 
	states that the band then changed their name to Grupo Aventura. That same year that they signed was the year they released
	their first album "Generation Next", which was very well received. The next year, in 2002, the band released their second 
	album called "We Broke The Rules". This album included the hit song "Obsesión', and it transformed Aventura into the most
	popular Latin boy band at the time. After many years of being in the group, Romeo Santos decided to leave the group and 
	pursue a solo career in 2011. He proceeded to continue his success solo, by selling out three consecutive nights at Madison
	Square Garden in 2012, and selling out a double show at Yankee Stadium. His album "Formula Vol. 1" that was released in 2011
	became the one of the most popular Latin music albums of that same year including the following year (2012). His second album
	"Formula Vol. 2", which was released in 2014, became the best-selling album of that year. His newest single is "Héroe Favorito",
	which was released in early 2017.
